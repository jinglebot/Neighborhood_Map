# FRONTEND NANODEGREE NEIGHBORHOOD MAP PROJECT



A. What I did so far:

1. do layout of location list and display

	- Bootstrap makes it easy

2. create list `<ul>`, update to knockout

	- `<ul>` by knockout, map by js/jQuery

3. add list filter functionality
 
	- use knockout data-bind

4. create map display
 
	- should only be called once
	
5. add markers
 
	- make markers as property of location object
	 
6. add markers filter functionality

	- use event listener

7. get `<li>`s click functionality to link to open infowindow

	- use event listener
	 
8. add APIs

	- get oauth signature successfully
	- get results to display on page

9. add hamburger menu functionality

10. submit



B. Problems encountered:

1. [x] get Google map to display

	- get API key

2. [x] complete an array of locations to use

	- get at least 5 locations with title, address and lat/lng values

3. [x] determine how to filter the array

4. [x] put markers on the map

	- [x] get markers to show using lat/lng values in the array
	
	- [x] create markers in viewmodel
	 
5. [x] determine how to filter the markers

6. [x] determine how to link `<li>`s with infowindow

7. [x] get APIs to show

	- [x] which API to use -- Yelp
	
	- [ ] where to include API -- infowindows

8.  [ ] make sure there is separation of concerns in mvc style: model, view and viewmodel

9.  [ ] how to place error catch
